I programmed nearly all the code in these assignments. The only things I did not program myself were the interfaces outlining the methods to implement.
This class taught me about Object Oriented Programming, GIT, Java, and Design Patterns. All of these assignments were programmed in Java.
In the final project, I made my own game with GUI called Nonograms (a sudoku-style puzzle game) using JUnit.
